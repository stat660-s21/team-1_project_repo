/*
Question 1 of 3: What are the main language spoken by English learners (EL) and 
Fluent-English-Proficient (FEP) students in different schools? Can we find 
anything interesting among them? 

Rationale: To take a look at the percentage of different languages, which would 
help school gain culture diversity. And to see if some type of native languages 
will have positive influence on the students’ English proficiency.

Note: This compares the column “Language”, “School” from elsch19 to the 
column of the same name from fepsch19.

Limitations: Values of "Language" and "School" equal to zero or empty should be 
excluded from this analysis, since they are potentially missing data values.
